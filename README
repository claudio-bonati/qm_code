All the scripts have a __main__ for unit testing or explanations that can be
used as an example of use.


fd_3p_d.py  finite differences with 3 points discretization of the second
            derivative and Dirichlet boundary conditions.

fd_3p_p.py  finite differences with 3 points discretization of the second
            derivative and periodic boundary conditions.

fd_5p_d.py  finite differences with 5 points discretization of the second
            derivative and Dirichlet boundary conditions.

fd_5p_d.py  finite differences with 5 points discretization of the second
            derivative and periodic boundary conditions.

fft_p.py    Fourier method with periodic boundary conditions.

*********************************

If the folder "qm_solver" is saved in the working area one can use the
following lines to add it to the pythonpath:

import sys
import os

try:
  with open("qm_solver/fd_3p_d.py") as f: 
    pass
except:
  print("Get the package 'statanalysis' from")
  print("https://github.com/claudio-bonati/qm_solver")
  print("and put it in this directory.")
  print()
  print("If you have 'git' installed you can use")
  print("git clone https://github.com/claudio-bonati/qm_solver")
  print()
  sys.exit(1)

sys.path.append(os.getcwd()+"/qm_solver")
