If the folder "qm_code" is saved in the working area one can use the
following lines to add it to the pythonpath:

import sys
import os

try:
  with open("qm_solver/fd_3p_d.py") as f: 
    pass
except:
  print("Get the package 'qm_code' from")
  print("https://github.com/claudio-bonati/qm_code")
  print("and put it in this directory.")
  print()
  print("If you have 'git' installed you can use")
  print("git clone https://github.com/claudio-bonati/qm_code")
  print()
  sys.exit(1)

sys.path.append(os.getcwd()+"/qm_code")
